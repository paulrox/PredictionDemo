# Prediction Demo

Simple demo application to test a prediction algorithm able to predict the future mouse position by acquiring the actual one in real-time. In addiction, the application simulates noise on the mouse position acquisition and applies a low-pass filter in order to reduce it.

## Getting Started

In order to compile the application, you need:

* [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/) - Used to develop the GUI


After installing Allegro, compile simply executing:

```
make
```

## Running the simulation

Simply execute the "pred_demo" application and follow the on screen instructions.
